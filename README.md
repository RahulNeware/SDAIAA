Satellite Data Analytics in Agriculture Areas
The research for this project was divided into three stages. In the first stage, I wrote a python script to automate downloading of multiple sentinel-2 satellite images from ESA (European Space Agency) server.
In the second stage I created a framework to classify sentinel-2 images according to their land used features to ascertain agriculture areas. I used NDVI, Supervised and Object-Based classification techniques to classify sentinel-2 high spectral images. In this project we considered only 4 types of land used class: agriculture, buildings, forest and barer land. This framework can classify satellite images regardless of their type.
In the third stage I created the grid-wise scenario on the agriculture areas of classified images. I used 2X2, 5X5 and 10X10 pixel grids on that area to get a knowledge base, which is used in trend analysis in agriculture area of Indian farmlands. The result we got was nearly 80% right, proving that analytics is really helpful for the Indian government and farmers, too. This project was executed over a period of six months, and I submitted it as my M. Tech final year project.
